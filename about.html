    <p id="about-text">Born in Newport Beach, California, Jay spent his youth growing up in Southern California. 
        He began playing drums at the age of eight and played in bands throughout the area. While attending Mission Viejo High School, 
        Jay excelled academically and participated in the school’s theater program. Graduating with a 4.0 GPA, Jay was accepted to the 
        University Of Washington where he studied economics. He later finished his studies at California State University, Monterey Bay 
        after founding the university’s entrepreneurship club in 2012. After graduation, he continued his business studies at the 
        University of Portland. Jay and a group of six graduate students travelled to Ireland to participate in a week-long marketing 
        conference where they visited with executives from Guinness, Irish International, and Benchmark Travel. He graduated in 2015 with 
        a Masters of Business Administration degree.  As a freshly-minted MBA, Jay went to work for OneWest Bank in the firm’s retail banking department. There, he met 
        with CEO and then-future Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, and implemented a successful marketing campaign with a budget of 
        $60,000. Then, Jay took his talents to the world of accounting. As a staff accountant at DVM Management, a CPA firm specializing 
        in dental and vetrenary pracitces, Jay managed the entire firm’s bookkeeping portfolio. Desiring a new direction in his career, 
        Jay moved to Phoenix, Arizona in 2019 where he joined Schuff Steel as a welder/fitter. There he earned multiple welding and crane 
        certifications and helped to complete over 35 major fabrication projects including the Las Vegas Raiders’ stadium and a Google 
        building located in Palo Alto. His welding specialities include MIG, stick, submerged arc, and flux core welding, as well as, 
        acetylene cutting. After a year and a half with Schuff Steel, Jay spent a year working at Amazon’s customer returns facility. 
        There, he was ranked among the top 3% in performance. </p>
